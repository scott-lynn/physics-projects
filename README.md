## Physics Projects
Small scale physics projects developed in modern Fortran throughout my university studies.

#### Project Guide
- dla: Diffusion Limited Aggregation simulation.
- ode: Solves the radioactive decay ODE and the SHM SODE using euler and leapfrog numerical methods.
- pde: Solves the Heat Equation using FTCS and BTCS numerical schemes for periodic boundary conditions and Dirichlet boundary conditions.
- rng: Random number generator.
- duffosc: Models the duffing oscillator using RK2 and RK4 (Runge-Kutta) numerical schemes. 
- signal_processing : DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) method for modelling signals. FFT based method for image proccessing tasks such as edge detection and removal of blur from an image.
